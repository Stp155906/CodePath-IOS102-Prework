This iOS application is part of the prework required for the CodePath iOS development course. The primary function of the app is to provide a simple user interface where students can input their personal information and receive a customized greeting.

## Features

- **User Input**: Utilizes `UITextField` to gather user input.
- **Segmented Control**: Implements a `UISegmentedControl` for selecting the current academic year.

- **Switch Control**: Includes a `UISwitch` to specify the desire for more pets.
- **Dynamic Output**: Compiles input data into a personalized introduction using a `UIAlertController`.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Swift Programming**: Writing Swift code to manage user interactions.
- **Interface Builder**: Designing a user interface with various UI elements.
- **MVC Architecture**: Structuring code following the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
- **Auto Layout**: Ensuring the app's layout functions correctly across different device sizes.
- **Optionals Handling**: Safely unwrapping optional values to prevent runtime crashes.
- **String Interpolation**: Dynamically creating strings based on user input.

## About Me

As a student at California State University, Northridge (CSUN), I am excited to participate in the IOS102 Session of Codepath This project reflects my initial step towards mastering app development, showcasing my ability to translate user requirements into a functioning software product.


Thank you for considering my application for the CodePath iOS course.
